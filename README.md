# The Monty Hall Problem

This is a simple simulation of the Monty Hall problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) written entirely in Ruby. Results will be printed to the command line.

## Setup & Run

After cloning this project, you should be able to simply run ```ruby monty_hall.rb``` in your terminal. You will be prompted to enter however many rounds of the game you would like to simulate. For this particular challenge, you can enter 10,000 and you should see that keeping the initial door picked will give you around a 1/3 chance of winning, whereas switching your choice will result in around a 2/3 chance of winning. 

## Results

Pictured below are a few runs of the program. Please note that in each instance, the odds of winning when the player sticks to the original door are around 33.3%, and the odds of winning when the player switches doors are around 66.7%. This is expected behavior, which proves that our simulations of the Monty Hall problem are working correctly!
